## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**vertical** | **String** | Vertical constraint (relative to containing frame) as an enum:  - `TOP`: Node is laid out relative to top of the containing frame - `BOTTOM`: Node is laid out relative to bottom of the containing frame - `CENTER`: Node is vertically centered relative to containing frame - `TOP_BOTTOM`: Both top and bottom of node are constrained relative to containing frame (node stretches with frame) - `SCALE`: Node scales vertically with containing frame | 
**horizontal** | **String** | Horizontal constraint (relative to containing frame) as an enum:  - `LEFT`: Node is laid out relative to left of the containing frame - `RIGHT`: Node is laid out relative to right of the containing frame - `CENTER`: Node is horizontally centered relative to containing frame - `LEFT_RIGHT`: Both left and right of node are constrained relative to containing frame (node stretches with frame) - `SCALE`: Node scales horizontally with containing frame |
